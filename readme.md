## About Resource Editor: ##

Resource Editor 2.1 is written in 4th Dimension version 6.7, and it includes the uncompiled source as well as a compiled version. It can be used with newer versions of 4th Dimension and has been tested through 4D 2004. Resource Editor v2.1 makes it possible to do common resource file editing and creation on the Windows platform. No Macintosh is required.

## Features: ##

  -  Side-by-side editing of string resources, making it easier to localize a "child" resource file based on a "parent" resource file.
  -  Create and edit resources in a resource file: Strings (STR, STR#), Constants (4DK#), Pictures (PICT), Text (TEXT), and for plugin developers, the THM# and FON# resources.
  -  Convert a parent resource file's strings into a "Pig Latin" child file, making it easy to spot strings that you forgot to localize on your forms and in your code.
  -  Export resource lists
  -  Import resource lists
  -  Asian mode for double-byte character sets
  -  Print resource lists
  -  Basic Find and Replace functions
  -  There are many bug fixes and usability improvements in version 2.0. These are outlined in an RTF file included with the download. Also, a complete context-sensitive help file is provided that describes each function of the application.

## New in Version 2.1: ##

Version 2.1 adds support for creating and editing TEXT resources (many thanks go to Pasi Mankinen for contributing this new code!), as well as a mechanism for clearing the list of recently opened files.

## New in Version 2.0.1: ##

Fixed a bug that made it impossible to create a new PICT resource.

## New in Version 2.0: ##

In addition to bug fixes and a much nicer and easier user interface, we've added the ability to create and edit PICT resources on Windows. For plugin developers, we've added a feature to create a FON# resource that links your plugin calls to the appropriate THM# resource.
